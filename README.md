## ABSTRACT

CAPTCHA images have been used for a while to determine if a user of a service is a real person or a machine. In this paper we address the question of whether these image tests are advanced enough to defeat current image processing algorithms. By trying a variety of different models on two different CAPTCHA datasets (CAPTCHA and ReCAPTCHA v2), we are able to compare the effectiveness of our best models on both datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks created in Keras were able to perform very well against the first generation of CAPTCHA images, but the team had to find more powerful methods to create the best model for ReCAPTCHA images.
