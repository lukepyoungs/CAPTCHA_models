**CAPTCHA Models Project** is focused on developing and training machine learning models to solve CAPTCHA challenges, including reCAPTCHA. The project explores image preprocessing techniques and utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve high accuracy.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **📸 Image Preprocessing:** Custom functions for image thresholding, dilation, smoothing, and more using OpenCV.
- **🧠 CNN Implementation:** Utilizes InceptionV3 architecture, fine-tuned for CAPTCHA image classification.
- **🔄 Data Augmentation:** ImageDataGenerator used for rescaling, zooming, and flipping images during training.
- **📊 Model Evaluation:** Detailed accuracy and loss plots, along with classification reports for model performance.

> **Status:** This project is complete, showcasing CAPTCHA-solving models built with TensorFlow and Keras.
